There are 5 music segments, 5 words, and 10 speech sentences eavesdropped by EMear. We also include the recovery results of a 4-minutes phone call downloaded from youtube (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjxRRmovFxU). 

The original audios are played via the Sennheiser PXC 550 headphone and a Huawei MateBook D14 as the player. The ESP attack prototype is hind underneath an office table and is placed 50cm away from the headphone and player. 

* The following picture shows the attack scene during the testing.

* Files named in the form of "_Recovered_XXXX.wav" are the recovered audios.
